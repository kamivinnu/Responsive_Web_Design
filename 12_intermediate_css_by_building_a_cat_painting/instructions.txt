Step 37
To remove all the pointed edges of the ear, set a bottom-right and bottom-left border radius of 40% each, a top-left border radius of 90px, and a top-right border radius of 10px.

Step 38
It's time to work on the right inner ear. Using a class selector, give your .cat-right-inner-ear element a left and right border of 20px solid transparent. Also, give it a bottom border of 40px solid #3b3b4f.

Step 39
Move the right inner ear into position with a position property set to absolute, a top of 22px and a left of -20px.

Step 40
As you did for the left inner ear, remove the sharp edges of the right inner ear by setting a bottom-right and bottom-left border radius of 40%, a top-left border radius of 90px, and a top-right border radius of 10px.

Step 41
You will now start working on the cat's eyes. Like the ears, the eyes will have inner eyes.

Create a div element with the class cat-eyes. Inside the .cat-eyes element, create two div elements with the class cat-left-eye and cat-right-eye respectively.

Step 42
Create two div elements, one with the class cat-left-inner-eye inside the .cat-left-eye element and another with the class cat-right-inner-eye inside the .cat-right-eye element.

Step 43
Using a class selector, give your .cat-left-eye element a width of 30px and a height of 40px. Also, give it a background-color of #000.

Step 44
Move the left eye into position with a position property of absolute, a top of 54px, and a left of 39px.

Step 45
To make the left eye look like an eye, give it a border radius of 60%. Also, using the transform property, rotate it at 25 degrees.

Step 46
Now you will work on the right eye by using the same approach.

Using a class selector, give your .cat-right-eye element a width of 30px and a height of 40px. Also, give it a background color of #000.

Step 49
Those look like eyes, but you can still make them better. That's why you created two inner eyes div elements.

Using a class selector, give your .cat-left-inner-eye element a width of 10px and a height of 20px. Also, give it a background color of #fff.

Step 50
Move the left inner eye into position with a position property of absolute, a top of 8px, and a left of 2px. Also, give it a border radius of 60% and rotate it at 10 degrees.

Step 51
Using a class selector, give your .cat-right-inner-eye element a width of 10px and a height of 20px. Also, give it a background color of #fff.

Step 52
Move the right inner eye into position with a position of absolute, a top of 8px, and a left of 18px. Also, give it a border radius of 60% and rotate it at -5deg.


Step 53
It's time to work on the nose. In your HTML, create a div element with the class cat-nose.

Step 54
Using a class selector, give your .cat-nose element a left and right border of 15px solid transparent each. Also give it a bottom border of 20px solid #442c2c.

Step 55
Move the nose into position with a position property of absolute, a top of 108px, and a left of 85px.

Step 56
Remove the sharp edges of the nose with border radius of 50% each on the top-left, bottom-right, and bottom-left corners. Also, rotate it at 180 degrees.

Step 57
Now you will start working on the mouth. There will be a right line and left line for the mouth.

Create a div element with the class cat-mouth.

Step 58
Inside your .cat-mouth element, create a div element with the class cat-mouth-line-left and another div with the class cat-mouth-line-right.

Step 59
Using a descendant selector, select the two div elements inside the div with class cat-mouth. Give it a width of 30px, a height of 50px, and a border of 2px solid #000.

Step 60
You are going to make the two mouth lines into an elliptical shape. So, give the .cat-mouth div selector a border color of black transparent transparent transparent and a border radius of 190%/190px 150px 0 0.

Step 61
Using a class selector, give your .cat-mouth-line-left element a position of absolute, a top of 88px and a left of 74px. This would move it into the right position.

Step 62
Using the transform property, rotate the left mouth line at 170 degrees.

Step 63
Access your .cat-mouth-line-right element with a class selector, then move it into the right position with a position of absolute, a top of 88px and a left of 91px.

Step 64
Rotate the right mouth line at 165 degrees.

Step 65
The last thing you will work on is the whiskers. There are going to be 6 of them, meaning there will be three on each side.

Create a div element with the class cat-whiskers.

Step 66
Inside the .cat-whiskers element, create two div elements with the class cat-whiskers-left and cat-whiskers-right.

Step 67
Inside the .cat-whiskers-left element, create three div elements with the classes cat-whisker-left-top, cat-whisker-left-middle, and cat-whisker-left-bottom.

Step 68
Inside the .cat-whiskers-right element, create 3 div elements with the class cat-whisker-right-top, cat-whisker-right-middle, and cat-whisker-right-bottom.

Step 69
Use a descendant selector to target the three div elements inside your .cat-whiskers-left element. Give it a width of 40px, a height of 1px, and a background-color of #000.

Step 70
As you did in the previous step, use a descendant selector to target the three div elements inside your .cat-whiskers-right element. Give it a width of 40px, a height of 1px, and a background-color of #000.

Step 71
Using a class selector, move the .cat-whisker-left-top element into place with a position of absolute, a top of 120px, and a left of 52px.

Step 72
Rotate the left top whisker at 10 degrees.

Step 73
Use a class selector to target the .cat-whisker-left-middle element. Then move it into place with a position property set to absolute, a top of 127px, and a left of 52px.

Step 74
Rotate the left middle whisker at 3 degrees.

Step 75
Using a class selector, move the .cat-whisker-left-bottom into position with a position of absolute, a top of 134px, and a left of 52px.

Step 76
Rotate the left bottom whisker at -3 degrees.

Step 77
Now you will work on moving the right whiskers into place. Use class selector to target the .cat-whisker-right-top element and give it a position of absolute, a top of 120px, and a left of 109px.

Step 78
Rotate the top-right whisker at -10 degrees.

Step 79
Use a class selector to target the .cat-whisker-right-middle element, then move the right middle whisker into position with a position of absolute, a top of 127px, and a left of 109px.

Step 80
Rotate the right middle whisker at -3 degrees.

Step 81
Use class selector to target the .cat-whisker-right-bottom element, then move it into place with a position of absolute, a top of 134px, and a left of 109px.

Step 82
Rotate the bottom-right whisker at 3 degrees.

With this final step, your cat painting is now complete.
